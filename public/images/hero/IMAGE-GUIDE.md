## Image Guidelines:

- **Resolution**: Minimum 1920x1080px (Full HD), ideally 2560x1440px for retina displays
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9 or wider landscape orientation
- **Format**: JPEG optimized for web (quality 80-85%)
- **File Size**: Keep under 300KB per image (use compression tools)
- **Composition**: Ensure important subjects are center-weighted (text overlay will be centered)
- **Lighting**: Well-lit, bright images work best with the teal overlay

## Overlay Effect:

All images will have a **teal overlay** (`rgba(0, 116, 134, 0.7)`) applied to ensure white text remains readable. Keep this in mind when selecting images:
- Avoid images that are too dark
- Images with varied tonal ranges work well
- The overlay will give images a cohesive teal-tinted look
